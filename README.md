This is a completely self-coded algorithm (no pre-existing algorithms or resources were consulted).
I coded this 2 years ago, before I learned any algorithm theories

The programs takes in any English word and if it is mispelled (i.e. not in the English dictionary) then it produces guesses as to what word you were intending to spell
